Understanding Asymptotic Notation
Big O notation is a way to describe how fast an algorithm runs or how much space it needs, especially when the input becomes very large. 
It focuses on the most significant factors that affect performance and ignores smaller details. For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(n) means that the time it takes grows linearly with the input size.

When we analyze search operations:

Best case: The condition where the search finishes as quickly as possible. For example, in linear search, the element is found in the first position.

Average case: The typical scenario when running the algorithm on random inputs.

Worst case: The longest time it can take — for linear search, this is when the element is at the last position or not present at all.

Analysis
Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search: O(n) — checks each element one by one.

Binary Search: O(log n) — repeatedly splits the sorted data and narrows down the search.

Which is more suitable?
In my platform, if the dataset is unsorted or very small, linear search is practical because there is no need to sort the data first. 
But if the dataset is large and already sorted, binary search is definitely better as it is faster due to its logarithmic time complexity.
