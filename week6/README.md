# Week 6 ‚Äì Introduction to React & Single Page Applications (SPA)

## ‚úÖ Objectives

### 1. Define SPA and its benefits
A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that dynamically updates a single HTML page without reloading the whole page during navigation. It interacts with the browser by dynamically rewriting the current page.

**Benefits of SPA:**
- Faster loading after initial load
- Seamless user experience
- Efficient data loading (only necessary data fetched)
- Easier to build mobile-friendly apps

---

### 2. Define React and identify its working
**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces.

**How React works:**
- Uses a **component-based** architecture
- Renders UI using a **virtual DOM**
- Updates only parts of the page that change, improving performance

### 3. Identify the differences between SPA and MPA

| Feature              | SPA                                      | MPA                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Page Reload         | No full-page reload                      | Every action reloads a new page           |
| Speed               | Faster after first load                  | Slower due to frequent reloads            |
| Routing             | Handled on client side                   | Handled on server side                    |
| User Experience     | More dynamic and smooth                  | Traditional and less interactive          |
| Development         | Needs JS frameworks like React/Angular   | Simpler, often server-rendered            |

### 4. Explain Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application

**Pros:**
- Fast and responsive
- Reduced server load
- Reusable components
- Easier to turn into mobile apps (via React Native)

**Cons:**
- SEO limitations
- Initial load might be heavy
- Browser history and navigation can be tricky
- May not work well without JavaScript

---

### 5. Explain about React
React is an **open-source JavaScript library** used to build UIs, especially for SPAs. It follows a **declarative** approach and promotes **component-based** development.

---

### 6. Define Virtual DOM
The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. When a change occurs:
1. React updates the virtual DOM.
2. It compares (diffs) it with the previous version.
3. Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM.

This makes rendering faster and more efficient.

---

### 7. Explain Features of React
- **JSX** ‚Äì JavaScript + HTML syntax
- **Virtual DOM** ‚Äì Efficient rendering
- **Components** ‚Äì Reusable UI blocks
- **Unidirectional Data Flow** ‚Äì Predictable state management
- **Hooks** ‚Äì Functional components with lifecycle and state logic
- **Fast Rendering** ‚Äì High performance for large apps
