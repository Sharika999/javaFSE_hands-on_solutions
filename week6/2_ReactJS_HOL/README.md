# ReactJS Hands-On Lab â€“ Student Management Portal

This project is part of Week 6 assignment for the Java FSE program. It is a simple React app named **StudentApp** that displays basic content using React components.

##  Folder Name
`2_ReactJS_HOL`

## ðŸ”§ Features Implemented

- A React app created using `create-react-app`
- Three components: `Home`, `About`, and `Contact`
- All components display specific messages in the browser

## Screenshots

Screenshots of the output are included in the `outputs` folder for reference.

##  Conceptual Answers

###  1. Explain React components

React components are reusable and independent blocks of UI that can be rendered in a React application. Components help break the UI into smaller, manageable pieces. They can be class-based or function-based.

###  2. Differences between components and JavaScript functions

| JavaScript Function                | React Component                           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Performs a specific task or logic | Returns JSX that represents UI            |
| No JSX involved                   | Can return JSX (HTML-like syntax)         |
| Not rendered by React             | Rendered as part of the React DOM         |
| No state or lifecycle             | Can have state and lifecycle (in classes) |

###  3. Types of components

1. **Class Component** â€“ ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`
2. **Function Component** â€“ Simple functions that return JSX

---

###  4. Explain class component

A class component is a JavaScript class that extends `React.Component`. It must include a `render()` method to return JSX.

Example:
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

###  5. Explain function component
A function component is a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. It is simpler and recommended for most use-cases today (with hooks).

Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

###  6. Define component constructor
The constructor method is used in class components to initialize state and bind methods.

Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 };
}

###  7. Define render() function
The render() function is a required method in class components. It returns JSX which is rendered to the DOM.

Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
render() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
